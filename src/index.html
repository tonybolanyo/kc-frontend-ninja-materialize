                            <p>Flexbox, short for “flexible box,” is a layout mode introduced in CSS3
                                that determines how elements are arranged on a page so that they behave
                                predictably under different screen sizes and devices. It is called Flexbox
                                because of its ability to expand and shrink elements inside the the flex
                                box to best fill the available space.</p>

                        <p>Done is better than perfect. When you’re learning, build something until it works
                            correctly and looks decent, and then forget it and move on. Don’t look for
                            perfection. There are bigger and better things for you to be learning and working

                            and flexible. And solves most of the problems that classic CSS has in the

                        <p>Last week, one of my readers sent in a question: How do I become a
                            better visual designer? As I was thinking about how to answer this
                            question, my mind wandered to my experience with learning Mandarin
                            Chinese. Recently, I decided to teach myself Mandarin. When it comes
                            to learning a new language, you first have to start with the
                            fundamentals. Nouns, pronouns, and verbs form the basis for
                            conveying more complex ideas.</p>

                        <p>Is it possible to hit a million requests per second with Python?
                            Probably not until recently. A lot of companies are migrating away
                            from Python and to other programming languages so that they can
                            boost their operation performance and save on server prices, but
                            there’s no need really. Python can be right tool for the job.</p>

                            succeed or fail with either. Don’t just accept the love/hate propaganda
